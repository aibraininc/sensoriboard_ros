_This is the manual for calibrating motors using sensoriboards to ROS.
Following these steps will enable you to calibrate sensoriboards with ROS._

=== Recommended Tools
You will need these to calibrate.

Should have picture

* Motor with sensoriboard
* Computer

== Step 0. Find information about the motor
We need to find the max travel of the motor. For example, you can find the max travel at https://www.servocity.com/hs-81.
For HS-81 and HS-82MG the max travel is 165 degree and 2.87979 in radian

== Step 1. Find the raw encoder values of the motor

=== Step 1.1 Connect the sensorimotor and run
  cd ~/your_grethcen_sdk/sensoriboard_ros

	python get_current_pos.py

The terminal returns two values. The first value is the raw pan position and the second value is the raw tilt position


=== Step 1.2 Get the min and max value of the pan and tilt by moving the robot head left, right, up, down with your hands.

|====

The values printed on the terminal will be used as min, max for pan and tilt.

Also move the robot so that the robot is looking at the center. The values on the terminal will be the center value and used for calib_mid of pan and tilt.

=== Step 1.3 Update the configuration file

Open py/motor_param_test.yaml

For both pan and tilt

* Update act_rad with the max travel of the motor (in radians) we found at Step 0.
* Update act_min with the corresponding min value we found at step 1.2
* Update act_max with the corresponding max value we found at step 1.2
* Update calib_mid with the center value for pan or tilt we found at step 1.2

== Step 2. Check calibration using the simulation UI.

If you installed gretchen sdk, you can check the motor calibration with the simulation UI. First, run

	roslaunch course_material init_device.launch

When you move a robot with your hands, the robot in the simulation will move in the same direction. For example, if you move the robot 90 degrees, the robot in the simulation will move 90 degrees.
